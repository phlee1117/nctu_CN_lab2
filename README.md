# Network Topology with Mininet

This repository is lab for NCTU course "Introduction to Computer Networks 2018".

---
## Abstract

In this lab, we are going to write a Python program which can generate a network topology using Mininet and use iPerf to measure the bandwidth of the topology.

---
## Objectives

1. Learn how to create a network topology with Mininet
2. Learn how to measure the bandwidth in your network topology with iPerf

---
## Execution
> create network topology accroding to ./src/topo/topo0.png
> Execute in the Ubuntu container(mininet & python installed)
> If it shows errors like "mininet...File exists...", clean Mininet
> `$ [sudo] mn -c`

#### How to execute this program?

**1. Change directory to the location of the program**\
`$ cd /root/Network_Topology/src`

**2. Add execute permission to the program**\
`$ chmod +x topology.py`

**3. Run the program, it would enter Mininet cli-mode & Dump the information of hosts and switches**\
`$ ./topology.py`
`----info about hosts & switches-----`
`mininet>`

**4. Run iperf in server h2 & client h6, output the result of server to file ./out/result**\
`mininet> h2 iperf -s -u -i 1 > ./out/result &`
`mininet> h6 iperf -c 10.0.0.2 -u –i 1`

**5. The progrm would output the result of client, just like the followiㄒng screenshot**\
The rate of packet loss is an approximate value from 21% ~ 26%
(check the red block of the screenshot)

## Description

### Mininet API in Python
* **How to use Mininet API in Python?**\
Mininet provides many classes in the certain module.\
Use following ways to import modules in python script.\
`from mininet[.xxx] import ooo`\
or\
`import mininet[.xxx]`\
- **Meaning of Miniet API**
    - mininet.net.Mininet
        - Network emulation with hosts spawned in network namespaces.
        - We need the 'Mininet' class to creates a realistic virtual network.
    - mininet.topo.Topo
        - Data center network representation for structured multi-trees.
        - Create the customized network structure by inheriting the class 'Topo'.
    - mininet.node.OVSController
        - Use Open vSwitch as the OpenFlow controller.
    - mininet.link.TCLink
        - Use Link with symmetric TC interfaces. (a basic link is just a Virtual ETHernet)
    - mininet.util.dumpNodeConnections
        - A useful Function to dump the information about nodes.
        - We use this to check hosts & switches created by Mininet.
    - mininet.cli.CLI
        - Simple command-line interface to talk to nodes.
        - We use CLI to run iperf on certain hosts.
